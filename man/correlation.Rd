\title{Create an adjacency matrix based on correlation}
\usage{
correlation(x, method = "pearson", p.adjust = "none", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{`matrix`, where columns are the samples and the rows are features
(metabolites), cell entries are intensity values}

\item{method}{`character`, either "pearson", "spearman", "pearson_partial", or
"spearman_partial".}

\item{p.adjust}{`character`, method of p-value adjustment passed to `p.adjust`}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed to `corr.test` or `partialCorrelation`}
}
\value{
`list` containing two matrices, 
the first matrix contains correlation coefficients and 
the second matrix contains the corresponding p-values as obtained from the 
correlation algorithms `corr.test` or `partialCorrelation` (depending on the 
chosen `method`) and optionally the adjusted p.values (argument
`p.adjust`)
}
\description{
`correlation` infers an adjacency matrix using
correlation using the `corr.test` function (from the
`psych` package) or partialCorrelation. `correlation` extracts the 
reported pair-wise correlation coefficients from the function 
`corr.test` and `partialCorrelation` and will return
the weighted adjacency matrix of the correlation coefficients, together 
with the associated p-values.
}
\details{
If `"pearson"` or `"spearman"` is used as a `method`, the function
`corr.test` from `psych` will be employed.

If `"pearson_partial"` or `"spearman_partial"` is used as a `method` the
function `partialCorrelation` will be employed.

`method` will be passed to argument `method` in `corr.test`
(in the case of `"pearson"` or `"spearman"`) or to `method` in 
`partialCorrelation` (`"pearson"` and `"spearman"` for `"pearson_partial"` 
and `"spearman_partial"`, respectively).
}
\examples{
data("x_test", package = "MetNet")
x <- x_test[1:10, 3:ncol(x_test)]
x <- as.matrix(x)
correlation(x, method = "pearson")
