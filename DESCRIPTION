Description: MetNet contains functionality to infer metabolic network topologies from 
  quantitative data and high-resolution mass/charge information. Using statistical models
  (including correlation, mutual information, regression and Bayes statistics) and 
  quantitative data (intensity values of features) adjacency matrices are inferred that 
  can be combined to a consensus matrix. Mass differences calculated between mass/charge 
  values of features will be matched against a data frame of supplied mass/charge 
  differences referring to transformations of enzymatic activities. In a third step, 
  the two matrices are combined to form a adjacency matrix inferred from both quantitative 
  and structure information.
