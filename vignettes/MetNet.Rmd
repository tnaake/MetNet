abstract: >
    A major bottleneck of mass spectrometry-based metabolomic analysis is 
    still the rapid detection and annotation of unknown m/z features across
    biological matrices. Traditionally, the annotation was done manually 
    imposing constraints in reproducibility and automatization. 
    Furthermore, different analysis tools are typically used at different steps 
    of analyses which requires parsing of data and changing of environments.
    I present here `MetNet`, a novel `R` package, that is compatible 
    with the output of the `xcms`/`CAMERA` suite and that uses the 
    data-rich output of mass spectrometry metabolomics to putatively 
    link features on their relation to other features in the data set. 
    `MetNet` uses both structural and quantitative information of metabolomics 
    data for network inference that will guide metabolite annotation.

# Introduction {#sec:intro}
Among the main challenges in mass spectrometric metabolomic analysis is the 
high-throughput analysis of metabolic features, their fast detection and 
annotation.
By contrast to the screening of known, previously characterized,
metabolic features in these data, the putative annotation of unknown
features is often cumbersome and requires a lot of manual work, hindering
the biological information retrieval of these data.
High-resolution mass spectrometric data is often very rich in information
content and metabolic conversions, and reactions can be derived from structural
properties of features [@Breitling2006]. 
In addition to that, statistical associations between
features (based on their intensity values) can be a valuable resource to find 
co-synthesized or co-regulated metabolites, which are synthesized in the same
biosynthetic pathways. Given that an analysis tool within the `R` framework 
is still lacking that is
integrating the two features of mass spectrometric information commonly
acquired with mass spectrometers (m/z and intensity values), I developed
`MetNet` to close this gap.
The `MetNet` package comprises functionalities to infer network
topologies from high-resolution mass spectrometry data. `MetNet`
combines information from both structural data (differences in m/z values
of features) and statistical associations (intensity values of features per
sample) to propose putative metabolic networks that can be used for further
exploration.

The idea of using high-resolution mass spectrometry data for network 
construction was first proposed in @Breitling2006 and followed soon 
afterwards by a Cytoscape plugin, MetaNetter [@Jourdan2007], that 
is based on the inference of metabolic networks on molecular weight differences
and correlation (Pearson correlation and partial correlation). 

Inspired by the paper of @Marbach2012 different algorithms for network 
were implemented in `MetNet` to account for 
biases that are inherent in these statistical methods, followed by the 
calculation of a consensus adjacency matrix using the differently computed 
individual adjacency matrices. 

The two main functionalities of the package include the creation of 
adjacency matrices from structural properties, based on losses/addition of
functional groups defined by the user, and statistical associations. Currently,
the following statistical models are implemented to infer a statistical
adjacency matrix: Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator
(LASSO, L1-norm regression, [@Tibshirani1994]), Random Forest 
[@Breiman2001], Pearson and Spearman correlation (including partial and
semipartial correlation, see @Steuer2006
for a discussion on correlation-based metabolic networks), correlation based on 
Gaussian Graphical Models (GGM, see @Krumsiek2011aa;@Benedetti2020aa for the advantages 
of using GGM instead of Pearson and partial pearson correlation), context likelihood 
of relatedness (CLR, [@Faith2007]), the algorithm for the reconstruction 
of accurate cellular networks (ARACNE, [@Margolin2006]) and 
constraint-based structure learning (Bayes, [@Scutari2010]). 
Since all of these methods have
advantages and disadvantages, the user has the possibility to select
several of these methods, compute adjacency matrices from these models and
create a consensus matrix from the different statistical frameworks. 

After creating the statistical and structural adjacency matrices these two 
matrices can be combined to form a consensus matrix that has information 
from both structural and statistical properties of the data. This can be followed 
by network analyses (e.g. calculation of topological parameters),
integration with other data sources (e.g. genomic information or
transcriptomic data) and/or visualization.

Central to `MetNet` is the `AdjacencyMatrix` class, derived from the
`SummarizedExperiment` S4 class. The `AdjacencyMatrix` host the adjacency
matrices creates during the different steps within the `assays` slot. They 
will furthermore store information on the `type` of the `AdjacencyMatrix`, 
i.e. if it was derived from `structural` or `statistical` properties or if 
it used the combined information from these layers (`combine`). It also 
stores information if the information was `thresholded`, e.g. by 
applying the `rtCorrection` or `threshold` function. Furthermore, the 
`AdjacencyMatrix` object stores information on if the graphs are directed 
or undirected (within the `directed` slot).

# Questions and bugs {-}

`MetNet` is currently under active development. If you
discover any bugs, typos or develop ideas of improving
`MetNet` feel free to raise an issue via
[Github](https://github.com/tnaake/MetNet) or
send a mail to the developer.

# Prepare the environment and load the data {#sec-prepare}
To install `MetNet` enter the following to the `R` console

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("MetNet")
```

Before starting with the analysis, load the `MetNet` package. This 
will also load the required packages `glmnet`, `stabs`, `GENIE3`, `mpmi`,
`parmigene`, `Hmisc`, `ppcor` and `bnlearn` that are needed
for functions in the statistical adjacency matrix inference.
```{r load_MetNet,eval=TRUE}
library(MetNet)
``` 

The data format that is compatible with the `MetNet` framework is
a `xcms`/`CAMERA` output-like $m~\times~n$ matrix, where
columns denote the different samples $n$ and where $m$ features are present.
In such a matrix, information about the masses of the features and quantitative
information of the features (intensity or concentration values) are needed. 
The information about the m/z values has to be stored in a vector of
length $\vert m \vert$ in the column `"mz"`. 

`MetNet` does not impose any requirements for
data normalization, filtering, etc. However, the user has to make sure that
the data is properly preprocessed. These include division by internal standard,
`log2` or `vsn` transformation, noise filtering, removal of features that do not 
represent mass features/metabolites, removal of isotopes, etc. 

We will load here the object `x_test` that contains m/z values
(in the column `"mz"`), together with the corresponding retention time
(in the column `"rt"`) and intensity values. We will use here the object
`x_test` for guidance through the workflow of `MetNet`.

```{r data,eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
data("x_test", package = "MetNet")
x_test <- as.matrix(x_test)
```

# Creating the structural adjacency {#sec-structural}

The function `structural` will create an `AdjacencyMatrix` object of 
`type` `structural` containing the adjacency
matrices based on structural properties (m/z values) of the features.

The function expects a matrix with a column `"mz"` that contains the 
mass information of a feature (typically the m/z value). Furthermore,
`structural` takes a `data.frame`
object as argument `transformation` with the `colnames`
`"mass"` and additional columns (e.g. `"group"`, `"formula"` or `"rt"`). 
`structural` looks for transformations (in the 
sense of additions/losses of functional groups mediated by biochemical,
enzymatic reactions) in the data using the mass information. 

Following the work of @Breitling2006 and @Jourdan2007, 
molecular weight difference w~X~ is defined by 
$w_X = \vert w_A - w_B \vert$

where w~A~ is the molecular weight
of substrate A, and w~B~ is the molecular weight of product B 
(typically, m/z values will be used as a proxy for the molecular weight since 
the molecular weight is not directly derivable from mass spectrometric data). 
As exemplified in @Jourdan2007, specific enzymatic reactions refer to 
specific changes in the molecular weight, e.g. carboxylation reactions 
will result in a mass difference of 43.98983 (molecular weight of CO~2~) 
between metabolic features. 

The search space for these transformation is adjustable by the 
`transformation` argument in 
`structural` allowing to look for specific 
enzymatic transformations. Hereby,
`structural` will take into account the 
`ppm` value, to adjust for inaccuracies in m/z values due to technical 
reasons according to the formula

$$ppm = \frac{m_{exp} - m_{calc}}{m_{exp}} \cdot 10^{-6}$$

with m~exp~ the experimentally determined m/z value and m~calc~ the
calculated accurate mass of a molecule. Within the function, a lower and upper
range is calculated depending on the supplied `ppm` value, differences
between the m/z feature values are calculated and matched against the
`"mass"`es of the `transformation` argument. If any
of the additions/losses defined in `transformation` is found in the
data, it will be reported as an (unweighted) connection in the assay
`"binary"` of the returned `AdjacencyMatrix` object. 

Together with this assay, additional `character` adjacency matrices can be 
written to the assay slot of the `AdjacencyMatri` object.
E.g. we can write the type of
connection/transformation (derived e.g. from the column `"group"` in the
`transformation` object) as a character matrix to the 
assay `"group"` by setting `var = "group"`. 

Before creating the `structural` `AdjacencyMatrix`, one must define the 
search space, i.e. the transformation that will be looked for in the mass spectrometric
data, by creating here the `transformations` object. 

```{r transformation_example,echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}
## define the search space for biochemical transformation 
transformations <- rbind(
    c("Hydroxylation (-H)", "O", 15.9949146221, "-"),
    c("Malonyl group (-H2O)", "C3H2O3", 86.0003939305, "+"),
    c("D-ribose (-H2O) (ribosylation)", "C5H8O4", 132.0422587452, "-"),
    c("C6H10O6", "C6H10O6", 178.0477380536, "-"),
    c("Rhamnose (-H20)", "C6H10O4", 146.057910, "-"),
    c("Monosaccharide (-H2O)", "C6H10O5", 162.0528234315, "-"),
    c("Disaccharide (-H2O) #1", "C12H20O10", 324.105649, "-"),
    c("Disaccharide (-H2O) #2", "C12H20O11", 340.1005614851, "-"),
    c("Trisaccharide (-H2O)", "C18H30O15", 486.1584702945, "-"),
    c("Glucuronic acid (-H2O)", "C6H8O6", 176.0320879894, "?"),
    c("coumaroyl (-H2O)", "C9H6O2", 146.0367794368, "?"),
    c("feruloyl (-H2O)", "C9H6O2OCH2", 176.0473441231, "?"),
    c("sinapoyl (-H2O)", "C9H6O2OCH2OCH2", 206.0579088094, "?"),
    c("putrescine to spermidine (+C3H7N)", "C3H7N", 57.0578492299, "?"))

## convert to data frame
transformations <- data.frame(
    group = transformations[, 1],
    formula = transformations[, 2],
    mass = as.numeric(transformations[, 3]),
    rt = transformations[, 4])
```

The function `structural` will then check for those 
m/z differences that are stored in the column `"mass"` in the 
object `transformations`. To create the `AdjacencyMatrix` object derived 
from these structural information we enter

```{r structure, eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
struct_adj <- structural(x = x_test, transformation = transformations, 
    var = c("group", "formula", "mass"), ppm = 10)
```
in the `R` console. 

As we set `var = c("group", "formula", "mass")`, the `AdjacencyMatrix` object
will contain the assays `"group"`, `"formula"`, and `"mass"` that store the
`character` adjacency matrices with the information defined in 
the columns of `transformations`.

## Advanced topic: Creating a directed structural graph

By default, the `structural` `AdjacencyMatrix` object and the contained
adjacency matrices are undirected (the
argument in `structural` is set to `directed = FALSE` by default; i.e. the
matrices are symmetric). `MetNet`,
however, also allows to include the information on the directionality of 
the transformation (e.g. to distinguish between additions and losses).
This behaviour can be specified by setting `directed = TRUE`:

```{r structure_dir, eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
struct_adj_dir <- structural(x = x_test, transformation = transformations, 
    var = c("group", "formula", "mass"), ppm = 10, directed = TRUE)
```

In the following we will visualize the results from the undirected and 
directed structural network. 

We will set the mode of the `igraph` object
to `"directed"` in both cases to make the distinction between the returned
outputs of `structural` for setting `directed = FALSE` and `directed = TRUE`.
Alternatively, we could also set the `mode` for the first `igraph` object
(using the undirected output of `structural`) to `"undirected"` which results
in an `igraph` object where the directionality of the edges is not retained. 

```{r visualization_directed}
g_undirected <- igraph::graph_from_adjacency_matrix(
    assay(struct_adj, "binary"), mode = "directed", weighted = NULL)
plot(g_undirected, edge.width = 1, edge.arrow.size = 0.5,
     vertex.label.cex = 0.5, edge.color = "grey")
g_directed <- igraph::graph_from_adjacency_matrix(
    assay(struct_adj_dir, "binary"), mode = "directed", weighted = NULL)
plot(g_directed, edge.width = 1, edge.arrow.size = 0.5,
     vertex.label.cex = 0.5, edge.color = "grey")
```


## Advanced topic: Refining the structural adjacency (optional) {-}
The retention time will differ depending
on the chemical group added, e.g. an addition of a glycosyl group will 
usually result in a lower retentiom time in reverse-phase chromatography.
This information can be used in refining the adjacency matrix derived from 
the structural matrix. The `rtCorrection` function does this check, if the
predicted transformations correspond to the expected retention time shift, 
in an automated fashion. It requires information about the expected retention
time shift in the `data.frame` passed to the `transformation`
argument (in the `"rt"` column). Within this column, information about
retention time shifts is encoded by `"-"`, `"+"` and `"?"`, 
which means the feature with higher m/z value has lower, higher or unknown 
retention time than the feature with the lower m/z value. The values for 
m/z and retention time will be taken from the object passed to the 
`x` argument. In case there is a discrepancy between the transformation
and the retention time shift, the adjacency matrix at the specific position
will be set to 0. `rtCorrection` will return the an `AdjacencyMatrix` object
with updated adjacency matrices (`"binary"` and the additional 
`character` adjacecny matrices).

To account for retention time shifts we enter

```{r rt_correction, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
struct_adj <- rtCorrection(am = struct_adj, x = x_test, 
    transformation = transformations, var = "group")
```
in the `R` console. The character `"group"` defined with `var` will serve 
here as the link between the assay `"group"` and the column in `transformation`
to calculate the retention time discrepancies between feature pairs.

For data analysis a `data.frame` can be generated from `AdjacencyMatrix` objects 
by applying `as.data.frame()`. Further filtering displays only feature-pairs 
which were matched to a transformation. 

```{r,eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
struct_df <- as.data.frame(struct_adj)
struct_df <- struct_df[struct_df$binary == 1, ]
```

Some overview on the mass-difference distribution of the data can be observed 
using the `mz_summary` function. The number of determined mass differences
can be displayed by using the `mz_vis` function.

```{r mz_summary,eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
mz_sum <- mz_summary(struct_adj, var = "group")
mz_vis(mz_sum, var = "group")
```

For larger data-sets, also a `filter` can be 
applied to visualize mass-difference above a defined threshold.
A filter can be applied, by `filter`. Since the maximum count of any mass difference in `struct_adj` is 4, a filter of `5` results in 0 mass differences.
```{r mz_summary_filter}
mz_summary(struct_adj, filter = 4)
mz_summary(struct_adj, filter = 5)
```

The `AdjacencyMatrix` class allows storing further information on the features 
as putative annotations, database identifier, SMILES, etc. using `rowData()`. 
A `data.frame` containing the same `rownames` as the test data needs to be 
provided. The columns can store different information as annotations, identifier, etc.
We will load the `x_annotation` file, which contains an example annotation 
and other identifier for feature `x1856`. All the other features contain `NA`s 
in corresponding columns. 

```{r,eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
data("x_annotation", package = "MetNet")
x_annotation <- as.data.frame(x_annotation)

## add annotations to the structural AdjacencyMatrix object
rowData(struct_adj) <- x_annotation

## display annotation for the feature "1856"
rowData(struct_adj)["x1856", ]
```



# Creating the spectral adjacency {#sec-spectral}
The function `spectral` will create an `AdjacencyMatrix` object of type 
`spectral` containing the adjacency matrices based on MS2 spectral similarity. 
It is a wrapper function that uses functionalities from `Spectra` and `MetNet` 
in order to create the `AdjacencyMatrix`. 
The function will create weighted adjacency matrices using the spectral 
similarity methods defined by the `methods` argument. The default is the 
normalized dotproduct `"ndotproduct"`. Moreover, different parameters (e.g. 
`MAPFUN`, `tolerance`, `ppm`, `type`, ...) of are forwarded to the function
`Spectra::compareSpectra()`. 
`spectral` uses a `Spectra` object, containing a unique "id" (in 
`spectraVariables()`), matching to the feature names of the MS1 data that will 
be provided by the structural `AdjacencyMatrix`. Also, the `Spectra` object is 
required to have unique `"id"`s, meaning on representative spectrum per feature. 
If features store multiple spectra, spectra consolidation has to be performed 
first (e.g. using the function `Spectra::combineSpectra`).

For further information on the different spectral similarity methods and input 
parameters take a look on the respective help pages of `Spectra::compareSpectra`.


In the following example, we load a toy MS2 dataset, represented as `Spectra` 
object. This object already stores unique id's and matching to the respective 
MS1 data.
We will then create a spectral similarity adjacency matrices using the 
normalized dotproduct and the previously created "structural" `AdjacencyMatrix`
as input data. 


```{r spectral,eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
data("ms2_test", package = "MetNet")

spect_adj <- spectral(x = sps_sub, 
                       am_structural = struct_adj, 
                       methods = "ndotproduct", 
                       tolerance = 0.05)

```






# Creating the statistical adjacency {#sec-statistical}

## Creating weighted adjacency matrices using `statistical` {#subsec-statistical}
The function `statistical` will create an `AdjacencyMatrix` object of type 
`statistical` containing the adjacency
matrices based on statistical associations. The function will create  
weighted adjacency matrices using the statistical models defined by the 
`model` argument. Currently, the following models are available: 
LASSO (using `stabs`,
[@Hofner2015;@Thomas2017]), Random Forest (using `GENIE3`, 
CLR, ARACNE (the two latter using the package `mpmi` to calculate
Mutual Information using a nonparametric bias correction by 
Bias Corrected Mutual Information, and the functions `clr` and 
`aracne.a` from the `parmigene` package), Pearson and 
Spearman correlation (based on the 
`psych` package), partial and semipartial 
Pearson and Spearman correlation (using the `ppcor` package), correlation based
on Gaussian graphical models (using the `GeneNet` package [@Schafer2005aa])  and 
score-based structure learning returning the strength of the probabilistic 
relationships of the arcs of 
a Bayesian network, as learned from bootstrapped data (using the 
`boot.strength` with the Tabu greedy search as default
from the `bnlearn` package [@Scutari2010]). 

For further information on the different models 
take a look on the respective help pages of `lasso`, 
`randomForest`, `clr`, `aracne`, `correlation` and/or 
`bayes`. Arguments that are accepted by the respective underlying 
functions can be passed directly to the `statistical` 
function. In addition, 
arguments that are defined in the functions `lasso`, 
`randomForest`, `clr`, `aracne`, `correlation` and/or 
`bayes` can be passed to the functions. 

## Creating an unweighted adjacency matrix using `threshold` {#subsec-threshold}

From the `statistical` `AdjacencyMatrix` object the function `threshold`
will create an `AdjacencyMatrix` object with the derived 
unweighted adjacency matrix from the weighted adjacency matrices
unifying the information present from all statistical models. This 
unweighted adjacency matrix is stored in the assay `"consensus"`.

In the following example, we will create a list of unweighted adjacency matrices 
using 
Pearson and Spearman correlation using the intensity values as input data. 

```{r statistical,eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
x_int <- x_test[, 3:ncol(x_test)] |>
    as.matrix()
stat_adj <- statistical(x_int, model = c("pearson", "spearman"))
```

The reasoning behind this step is to circumvent disadvantages arising from each 
model and creating a statistically reliable topology that reflects the actual 
metabolic relations. `threshold` returns an unweighted adjacency
matrix with connections inferred from the respective models (in the 
`"consensus"` assay).

There are four different types implemented how the unweighted adjacency 
matrix can be created: `threshold`, `top1`, `top2`, `mean`.

For `type = "threshold"`, threshold values have to be defined in the 
`args` argument for the respective statistical model within the list entry
`filter`. Values above or below 
these thresholds in each respective weighted adjacency matrix will be 
reported as present (1) or absent (0) in the returned unweighted adjacency 
matrix. 

For the other three types (`top1`, `top2`, `mean`) the ranks per statistical model
will be calculated and from each respective link the top1, top2 or mean rank 
across statistical models will be calculated (cf. [@Hase2013]). The 
top n unique ranks (defined by the entry `n` in `args`) will be returned
as links in the unweighted consensus adjacency matrix. 


We will create here for all ways the thresholded `AdjacencyMatrix` objects of 
type `statistical` containing the consensus adjacency matrix.

```{r threshold,eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
## type = "threshold" 

## the assayNames in stat_adj are used to define the filter criteria
assayNames(stat_adj)

## return edges with positive Pearson correlation coefficients > 0.95
args_thr <- list(filter = "pearson_coef > 0.95")

## return edges with positive Spearman correlation coefficients > 0.95
args_thr <- list(filter = "spearman_coef > 0.95")

## return edges with absolute Pearson correlation coefficients > 0.95 and 
## associated p-values <= 0.05
args_thr <- list(filter = "abs(pearson_coef) > 0.95 & pearson_pvalue <= 0.05")

## return edges with absolute Pearson OR Spearman correlation coefficients > 0.95
args_thr <- list(filter = "abs(pearson_coef) > 0.95 | abs(spearman_coef) > 0.95")

## return edges with absolute Pearson AND Spearman correlation coefficients > 0.95
args_thr <- list(filter = "abs(pearson_coef) > 0.95 & abs(spearman_coef) > 0.95")

## pass the filtering criteria to the args argument and set type to "threshold"
stat_adj_thr <- threshold(am = stat_adj, type = "threshold", 
    args = args_thr)

## alternatively, use the types "top1", "top2", "mean"
## retrieve the feature pairs which have the 100 highest coefficients
args_top <- list(n = 100)
## type = "top1" 
stat_adj_top1 <- threshold(am = stat_adj, type = "top1", 
    args = args_top)

## type = "top2"
stat_adj_top2 <- threshold(am = stat_adj, type = "top2", 
    args = args_top)
 
## type = "mean"
stat_adj_mean <- threshold(am = stat_adj, type = "mean", 
    args = args_top)
```

# Combining the structural and statistical matrix {#sec-combine}

After creating the `structural`  and `statistical` `AdjacencyMatrix` objects, 
the two objects are combined. The function `combine` 
will combine these two objects and create an `AdjacencyMatrix` object of type
`combine`. The function accepts 
the arguments `am_structural` and `am_statistical` for the respective
`AdjacencyMatrix` objects. Please note that for `am_structural` the 
`AdjacencyMatrix` obtained via `structural` or `rtCorrection` can be used,
while for `am_statistical` the `AdjacencyMatrix` from `threshold` has to be 
used. 
The edges that are present both in the `binary` assay and the `consensus` assay
will be reported within the `combine_binary` assay in a `combine` 
`AdjacencyMatrix` object. If there are additional assays in the 
`AdjacencyMatrix` of type `structural` these matrices will be stored in the 
`AdjacencyMatrix` of type `combine` and will contain the edges that are 
supported by the `combine_binary` adjacency matrix (the other edges are 
set to "").

We will use here the thresholded `statistical` `AdjacencyMatrix` from 
`type = "mean"` to combine it with the `structural` `AdjacencyMatrix`, 
`stat_adj`: 
```{r combine,eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
comb_adj <- combine(am_structural = struct_adj, am_statistical = stat_adj_mean)
```

# Visualization and further analyses {#sec-visualization}

To display the created consensus adjacency matrix, existing visualization 
tools available in the `R` framework can be employed or any other visualization 
tool after exporting the consensus matrix as a text file. In this example, 
we will use the `igraph` [@Csardi2006] package to visualize the 
adjacency matrix. 

We use here the assay `"combine_binary"` from the `AdjacencyMatrix` of type
`combine` and pass it to the `graph_from_adjacency_matrix` function:
```{r visualisation,eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE,fig.cap='_Ab initio_ network inferred from structural and  quantitative mass spectrometry data. Vertices are connected that are separated by given metabolic transformation and statistical association.'}
adj <- assay(comb_adj, "combine_binary")
g <- igraph::graph_from_adjacency_matrix(adj, mode = "undirected")
plot(g, edge.width = 2, vertex.label.cex = 0.5, edge.color = "grey")
```

Furthermore, the network can be analysed by network analysis techniques
(topological parameters such as centrality, degree, clustering indices) that 
are implemented in different packages in `R`
(e.g. `igraph` or `sna`) or other software tools outside of 
the `R` environment.
